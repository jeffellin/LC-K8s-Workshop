## What is Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source platform or tool that helps manage and automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications or services in a cluster of computers or servers.

Kubernetes acts as a central control system or a manager for all these tasks, called containers, which are like separate compartments or boxes. It helps you organize and handle all these containers efficiently.

Kubernetes makes sure that the containers are running smoothly and helps manage their resources, like how much memory or processing power each container needs. It also takes care of distributing the workload evenly across different computers or servers, so no single machine gets overloaded.

If one of the containers stops working or crashes, Kubernetes automatically restarts it to keep your tasks running without interruptions. It can also automatically create more containers if the workload increases, or remove unnecessary ones if the workload decreases, just like getting more friends to play when you need extra hands or asking some friends to leave when you're done.

Kubernetes also helps with communication and coordination between the containers. It provides networking features so that containers can talk to each other, share information, and work together as a team.

Overall, Kubernetes acts as a helpful manager for your applications or services, making sure they run smoothly, scale easily, and communicate effectively. It simplifies the management of complex systems and helps you focus more on your tasks rather than worrying about the underlying infrastructure

## Explain Kubernetes like I am 5

Imagine you have a bunch of toys scattered all over your room, and you want to organize them neatly.

Kubernetes is like a magical robot that helps you tidy up your toys. It has special shelves where you can put your toys in an organized way. The robot also knows how to handle different types of toys and keep track of where everything is.

But it's not just about tidying up. The robot also makes sure that your toys are always available for you to play with. It checks if any toy is missing or broken, and if so, it fixes or replaces it without you even noticing.

Sometimes, you may want to play with multiple toys at the same time, like building a big tower with blocks and driving toy cars around it. Kubernetes helps you with that too! It helps your toys work together smoothly, making sure they don't bump into each other and cause any mess.

So, Kubernetes is like a helpful robot that organizes your toys, keeps them in good condition, and makes sure they all play nicely together


## Desired State

In Kubernetes, the desired state refers to the configuration or specification of how you want your application or system to be running. It describes what you want Kubernetes to do in terms of managing and maintaining your application's resources.

The desired state includes information such as the number of replicas or instances of your application that should be running, the resources (like CPU and memory) that each instance should have, the network settings, and any other configurations specific to your application.

When you deploy your application to Kubernetes, you provide a description of the desired state using YAML or JSON files. Kubernetes then takes this desired state as input and continuously works to ensure that the actual state of your application matches the desired state.

Kubernetes monitors the current state of your application, and if there are any differences between the current state and the desired state, it takes appropriate actions to reconcile them. For example, if you specify that you want three instances of your application running, but Kubernetes detects that only two are running, it will automatically start a new instance to bring it back to the desired state.

In summary, the desired state in Kubernetes refers to the configuration or specification of how you want your application to be running, and Kubernetes constantly works to ensure that the actual state matches the desired state.
